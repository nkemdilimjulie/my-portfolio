                        Hello Everyone, <br>
                        My name is Nkemdilim Julie Chime. I come from Nigeria. I was born when my
                        age mates were born. I am a married woman with children.<br>
                        In my youthful period, when I was to be enrolled into the University, I
                        liked the name of a particular course called Computer Science . <br>So, even
                        before I came to know how a Computer looks like and what it could be used
                        for, <span class="span1">"I fell in love with Computer"</span> - so to
                        say! <br>That was why I graduated from the best University in my home country
                        then as a Computer Programmer in FORTRAN and Pascal Languages.<br>
                        Lastly, my hobbies are playing with children and site-seeing.
                      </p>
